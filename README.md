# TODO
* Dealer should not draw any more cards, if player has busted in one deck and has Blackjack in the other
* The faster the animation speed is, the more risk that the cards don't line up correctly
* If player has 2 decks for example, and has blackjack on one and stand on the other, blackjack winnings not calculated correctly (ref. Kalles screenshot) --> maybe
* Fix so that when drawing cards to a newly split deck, always draw to the right deck before the left
