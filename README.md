## How To Play
#### Before Game
* 'Arrow Keys' to adjust bet
* 'Enter' to place bet
#### During Game
* 'Enter' to hit (take another card)
* 'Space' to stand (decline another card)
* 'D' to double down (double the bet and only get *one* more card)
* 'S' to split (double the bet and divide the hand into two seperate hands)
#### After Game
* 'Space' to clear the board

## TODO
* Change versions on .jar files
* Add private and final to variables and methods, if needed
* Add 'int bet' to Hand class (each hand has its own bet) 
* Create Key class (move TAdapter)
* Increase animation speed when animating props (e.g. arrow)
* If player splits and has blackjack in last hand, it does not auto-stand
* Remove cardSize from GamePanel.java
* Update valueOfCardsToString when isAnimating = false (text under card)
