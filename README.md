# TODO
* Set standard names on all variables
* Add private and final to variables and methods, if needed
* Create Hand class
* Create Dealer class

* Dealer should not draw any more cards, if player has busted in one deck and has Blackjack in the other
* The faster the animation speed is, the more risk that the cards don't line up correctly
* Fix so that when drawing cards to a newly split deck, always draw to the right deck before the left
